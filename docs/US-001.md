US-001: Basic typing training (Dev-ready)

Story
As a user learning touch typing,
I want to type individual English words,
so that I can improve typing accuracy and speed.

Scope

Single-word training only (no sentences).

Web-only MVP.

No translations required in this story (covered by US-002).

UX / UI Specification

Screen shows:

Target word (large, centered).

Typing area (single-line input or custom input box).

Minimal feedback: per-character highlighting (correct/incorrect/pending).

Input is auto-focused on screen load and after each word completion.

No popups, no tooltips, no hover-based UI.

Keyboard behavior

Allowed keys:

a-z letters (case-insensitive input, treated as lowercase)

Backspace removes last typed character

Enter attempts to submit the word

Disallowed/ignored keys: arrows, tab, function keys, etc. (should not break input state)

Completion rules

A word is considered completed only when:

typed length equals target length and

all characters match target and

user presses Enter (MVP rule; auto-advance can be future option)

Error handling rules

On each keystroke:

compare typed string to target word

mark each character state as:

correct if matches at same index

incorrect if differs at same index

pending if not typed yet

Errors do not block typing; user can correct using backspace.

If user presses Enter with an incorrect/incomplete word:

do not advance

show subtle indication (e.g., shake animation OR brief “Not correct” status text). No modal.

Acceptance Criteria

The app displays exactly one target word at a time.

User can type letters and use backspace; input state updates immediately.

Incorrect characters are highlighted in real time.

Pressing Enter advances to the next word only when the current word is correct.

Focus remains in the typing area after word transitions.

Works reliably on MacBook keyboard in Chrome and Safari (minimum).

Definition of Done

Unit test (or minimal test) for completion logic (optional for MVP but recommended).

No visible lag on keypress (input handling must be synchronous and local).

No console errors on normal use.
